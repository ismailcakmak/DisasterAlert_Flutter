## Motiation

I decided to start the DisasterAlert project after the devastating earthquake that occurred in Kahramanmaras on February 6, 2023. Witnessing the lack of effective disaster management and the tragic loss of thousands of lives, I felt a strong need to create a solution that can help manage disasters and improve emergency response times. Through the DisasterAlert app, I hope to contribute to the efforts of building a safer and more resilient society.
